# Snail Scale Game

# Summary
This is a game called Snail Scale that I made using Claude.ai and ChatGPT for my Innovative Technologies for Design course

# About
Snail Scale is a game where players must navigate their snail through a field of red and green berries.  If the snail eats a green berry, players add a point to their score and the snail grows in size.  If the snail eats a red berry, players deduct a point from their score and the snail decreases in size.  The goal of the game is to grow your snail as large as possible in 30 seconds.  If players score 10 points or more in 30 seconds, they win the game.  If they fail to do so, it is game over!

# Reflection
I liked creating this project a lot.  Although I faced prompt quantity constraints, resulting in time limitations due to the free versions of Claude and ChatGPT, this was a very fun game to create.  I really enjoy game design and incorporating Play into the lives of others. I wish I was able to add more graphics into the game, so the snail was a cute animated character with a smile.
